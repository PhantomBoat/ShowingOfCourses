# Information Technology
This was an intro course running parallel with "recap of high school maths"-course. This course focused in large extent on the field and how the CS program would work and what resources were available.

The course only required limited programming of simple introductory problems in Python.

## The problem demonstrated
Sometimes you have a matrix on paper which you want to convert to digital, and preferably in such a way that Wolfram Alpha can do the work for you. 

This program takes inputs from the user and spits out a matrix formatted in {} to indicate vectors and a vector of vectors being a matrix.
